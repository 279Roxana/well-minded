# Well Minded
The main goal of the project is to create a space where people can get information about free support towards their mental health. The platform is meant to gather charities, free support groups, and free resources in the same place as at the moment, finding accessible professional support can be challenging. This fact may be discouraging for people who are already struggling and are trying to find alternative professional support,  as there are many users who have tried clinical settings and are looking for a therapeutic safe space. The platform can be used by people dealing with mental health issues or people from their support network. As the website will gather organisations, users will be redirected to the contact of these.
For the website to have an emphasis on mental health and to advocate this, it would need to have additional information. This would imply having resources displayed on the website, free courses, and specialised blogs that people can find helpful. 
Building a website that is easy to navigate is an important addition in order for it to be user friendly. This would mean allowing the user to search for the organisations and resources based on the type of support offered, keywords, and location.
In line with it being easy to navigate, it is meant to be a view-only website, users being able to access it without having to log in. However, in order to be up to date and easy to manage, it should have an admin login and it will also accept suggestions that would only be approved by admin.
Since Well-minded is meant to be a point of refuge for people facing mental health challenges it is important to make it available to everyone by taking into account website accessibility and implementing appropriate design and functionality. 
In conclusion, Well-minded is a user-friendly platform meant to promote free of charge professional mental health support and link users with appropriate means of support.
